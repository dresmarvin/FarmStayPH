			<h2 class="mb-5 about-tags">Our Mission</h2>
			<p class="text-justify lead">Agritourism has been building momentum in the Philippines for the last few years, and all the effort of local enterprises and farmers is finally being recognized as the country is now one of the top destinations for agritourism in the world.Various government and private sectors have been pushing for the development of the farm tourism industry, recognizing it is a way to integrate small farmers into the bigger supply chain, as well as promoting practice of environment-friendly agriculture.</p>
			<p class="text-justify lead">Agri-tourism has been present in the Philippines since the 1990s, but was not institutionally defined then. In those early days, most agri-tourism farms were either privately owned or managed.</p>
			<p class="text-justify lead">In 1991, the Philippines Department of Tourism (DOT) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) came together and formulated the Philippine Tourism Master Plan (TMP); aimed at developing tourism on an environmentally sustainable basis. In 2002, the Department of Agriculture (DAR) and DOT issued a joint circular that identified 10 agri-tourism sites in the country. With this accreditation, all sites would have to adhere to the minimum standards prescribed by the Department for all operations and maintenance activities; guaranteeing a satisfactory visit for the tourists.</p>
			<p class="text-justify lead">As a tropical country with an abundance of natural resources, biological diversity and a strong cultural heritage, the Philippines is well-positioned for agri-tourism. At present, the Philippines has a total of 32 agri-tourism sites, including 27 protected areas consisting of strawberry and organic vegetable farms in Benguet, as well as pineapple and coffee plantations in Bukidnon. The Philippines also hosts various events, including farmersâ€™ field days and agricultural fairs, which are estimated to be attended by 64,000 tourists each year.</p>

			<h2 class="mb-5 about-tags text-right">Our Vision</h2>
			<p class="text-justify lead">The envisioned integration of tourism and farming allows more efficient resource utilization which can provide jobs, increase income, business opportunities, and reduce urban migration. Farm tourism has the potential to sustain agricultural practices due to a steady stream of income that is less dependent on weather, markets, pests, or diseases.</p>
			<p class="text-justify lead">Since small farmers need to have numerous income stream in order to become globally competitive in light of ASEAN integration, farm tourism will be a key to helping lift farmers out of poverty.</p>
